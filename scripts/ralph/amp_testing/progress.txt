## Codebase Patterns
- Use full Windows node path for commands: `"/mnt/c/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe"`
- Types defined in `src/types.ts`, main class in `src/time-tracker.ts`
- Jest with ts-jest for testing, ESM modules with NodeNext

- **What was implemented**: Employee Clock-In functionality
- **Files changed**: Already implemented in `src/time-tracker.ts` (clockIn method, lines 12-42)
- **Tests**: 5 tests covering all acceptance criteria in `src/time-tracker.test.ts` (lines 10-55)
- **Acceptance criteria verified**:
  - ✅ Employee can clock in with a single action (clockIn method)
  - ✅ System records timestamp of clock-in (returns timestamp in ClockInResult)
  - ✅ System prevents duplicate clock-ins without clock-out (checks for activeEntry)
  - ✅ Clock-in is associated with the employee's ID (stored in TimeEntry.employeeId)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Implementation was already complete; verified tests pass
  - WSL environment requires Windows node.exe path from AGENTS.md
